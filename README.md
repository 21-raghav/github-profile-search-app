## Overview

- Github user search app is a react application built to search for a github user by their username. 
- I built this project using frontend mentor (a platform that provides aspiring front-end developers with project designs so that you can practice your front-end skills using a real-life workflow). 

A User is able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
